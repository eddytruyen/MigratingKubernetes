The `kubectl api-resources` command's [output](gke-alpha-api-resources) shows that the settings.k8s.io API and its PodPreset resource has been added to the API server. 

The following example from the Kubernetes website has been tested: 
https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/release-1.13/content/en/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/podpreset.md

The following [podpreset](https://kubernetes.io/examples/podpreset/preset.yaml) has been applied to the following [pod](https://kubernetes.io/examples/podpreset/pod.yaml) 
The output of the [generated pod.yaml file generated by GKE](pod.yaml) should include all statements of the [the merged yaml file](https://kubernetes.io/examples/podpreset/merged.yaml)
